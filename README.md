# NCS (Nightcore Community Script)

### Installation and Activation

NCS can be installed by visiting http://ncs.electricgaming.ga/new/#download and bookmarking the button there.

### What is NCS

After plug.dj shut down, the people in the Nightcore-331 community built their own backup site. And while we've lost a lot of the people
we once had, we're ever growing once again. Because of this, we made NCS as a replacement for RCS, so that we can add features,
and other things, that the default Nightcore-331 just doesn't have. You can find the new site here: https://alpha.nightcore-331.net

over to plug.dj again.
